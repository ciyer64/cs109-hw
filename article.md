**OP-ED: OF POLITICS AND PREDICTABILITY**

Probability is everywhere.  From everyday tasks like checking the weather, to more addictive habits like gambling, our lives involve some degree of uncertainty, and thus we are forced to rely upon chance.  Politics is no exception.  When discussing major upcoming events, such as elections, we love to make some prediction about what will happen.  As we are a democracy (in some cases), winning elections depends on getting the votes of the people.  Therefore it's only natural that we look at metrics that get a general sense of what the public is thinking, such as polls.

But how accurate are these polls?
